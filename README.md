📈 Odds Analyzer
Overview
The Odds Analyzer is a Streamlit web application designed to help analyze betting odds. It currently provides functionalities to convert American odds to implied probabilities and remove the sportsbook's 'vig' (juice) to reveal true probabilities. Future enhancements will include data pulling from various sources to estimate true probabilities for events.
